# _MalScraper_
This will be a npm module getting information about anime on MyAnimeList.net.

At the moment, MalScraper is not ready to be used as a NPM module (TODO).

At the moment, _MalScraper_ is able to:
* Gather information about all the anime being releases in a season

_MalScraper_ is being developed mainly for [_KawAnime_](https://github.com/Kylart/KawAnime) but anyone can use it for
 its own purpose.

Any contribution would be welcomed :simple_smile:
